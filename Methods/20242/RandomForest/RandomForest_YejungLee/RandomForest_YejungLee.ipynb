    "#### **[The situation before this methodology was introduced]**\n",
    "Random Forest, as the name suggests, is a concept **similar to a forest consisting of multiple trees**, where it is composed of multiple decision trees and serves as a supervised learning model. Therefore, **Random Forest is built upon decision trees**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a decision tree, **the entire dataset starts at the root node**, the topmost node of the tree, and then branches out based on the conditions of the subsequent nodes. When the data reaches a leaf node, which has no further branches, the data arriving at the same node is linked to the final prediction result. **The model learns by adding branching conditions until all the data reaches the leaf nodes.**\n",
    "\n",
    "However, decision trees are prone to **overfitting to the training data, especially as the tree becomes deeper, which can lead to bias issues**. **To address this, an improved algorithm was needed** that could strike a balance by not being too deep while still producing optimal results through diverse questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **[Why this methodology is introduced]**\n",
    " **Random Forest was introduced because it can address some of the drawbacks of decision trees, specifically issues of overfitting and bias.** For example, when faced with a question like \"Should I go surfing today?\", the questions asked to make a prediction may not be comprehensive. **However, Random Forest trains multiple trees with relatively shallow depths, allowing for the learning of data through a variety of questions. This approach is known as ensemble learning.**\n",
    "\n",
    " In contrast, a single CART model, like a decision tree, tends to become deeper and more complex as the number of features increases and the data becomes more diverse. This complexity can lead to overfitting, where the model fits too closely to the training data, or to bias in a specific direction. However, **Random Forest, which employs ensemble learning, generates multiple random samples from the dataset and trains several trees independently.** This process reduces the variance of the data and lowers the uncertainty of predictions.<br><br>\n",

    "#### **[Where it can be used]**\n",
    "The random forest algorithm has been applied across a number of industries, allowing them to make better business decisions. Some use cases include:\n",
    "- **Finance**: It is a preferred algorithm over others as it reduces time spent on data management and pre-processing tasks. It can be used to evaluate customers with high credit risk, to detect fraud, and option pricing problems.\n",
    "- **Healthcare**: The random forest algorithm has applications within computational biology, allowing doctors to tackle problems such as gene expression classification, biomarker discovery, and sequence annotation. As a result, doctors can make estimates around drug responses to specific medications.\n",
    "- **E-commerce**: It can be used for recommendation engines for cross-sell purposes. This means that it can be used in marketing to analyze user behavior data and preferences to recommend appropriate products or services, thereby encouraging additional sales."

    "    \n",
    "    In a tree model, the impurity of a node is a measure that evaluates the fit of the data at each node. The data in a node indicates how diverse it is, meaning how well different classes or categories are mixed. Nodes with low impurity are considered to have high predictive power, and therefore contribute to improving the performance of the tree model.\n",

    "    \n",

If a node contains only one class, the Gini index will be 0, and theoretically, it reaches its maximum when the impurity is the highest (when the classes are evenly mixed).\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Flexibility:** We can use this algorithm for regression as well as classification problems. It can be considered a handy algorithm because it produces better results even without hyperparameter tuning. Also, the parameters are pretty straightforward, they are easy to understand and there are also not that many of them.\n",
    "2. **Ensemble**: Decision trees can vary significantly based on the training data, making it challenging to generalize their use. Random forests address this issue by introducing randomness in variable selection and bagging, which decorrelates the predictions of each tree, thereby enhancing generalization performance and making them suitable for data that contains noise.\n",
    "3. **Parallel processing is possible**: Each tree is trained independently, allowing for faster training through parallel processing.\n",
    "4. **Variable Importance**: Through variable importance, we can estimate which variables play a significant role in the predictive performance."

    "1. **Regression**\n",
    "- **MSE**<br>\n",
    "While the train MSE is very low at 0.0105, the Test MSE is relatively high at 0.1512. This may indicate that the model is overfitting the training data. In other words, the model has learned the details of the training data well, but it struggles to generalize to new data (the test data).\n",
    "- **Feature Importance**<br>\n",
    "In terms of variable importance, the Green Space Area has emerged as overwhelmingly significant. This variable represents the ratio of green space in the city, indicating that a higher percentage of green space correlates with an increase in people's happiness scores. However, it is necessary to further investigate whether such a dominant result is due to a potential issue with the model.\n",
    "- **How it can be used?**<br>\n",
    "By predicting happiness scores through various characteristics of the city, we can suggest directions for urban development to enhance people's happiness. Additionally, gaining insights into living conditions and population satisfaction in urban environments allows this model to be utilized in creating effective urban policies and environments.\n",
    "2. **Classification**\n",
    "- **Accuracy**<br>\n",
    "The accuracy was highest when n_estimators was set to 151. I expected the accuracy to increase as the value of n_estimators grew, but it didn't. Therefore, it's important to try different n_estimators values and choose the model with the highest accuracy.\n",
    "- **Feature Importance**<br>\n",
    "  The variable that has the most significant impact on the overall evaluation of the vehicle is safety. The safety of the vehicle is crucial as it reflects the safety of both the driver and the passengers. The next most influential variable is persons. If the vehicle owner has a family, a car that can accommodate more people will have a positive effect on the purchasing decision. The variable that has the least impact is doors. In my opinion, since most vehicles have four doors, this factor does not significantly influence the overall evaluation of the vehicle.\n",
    "- **How it can be used?**<br>\n",
    "By evaluating various factors of the vehicle, we can determine the vehicle's rating. This rating aids in making purchasing decisions and allows for improvements in each aspect of the vehicle."
